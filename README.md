Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will emulate/simulate a traffic shaper that transmits/services packets controlled by a token bucket filter depicted below using multi-threading within a single process. If you are not familiar with pthreads, you should read Chapter 2 of our required textbook.

Figure 1: A system with a token bucket filter.

Figure 1 above depicts the system you are required to emulate. The token bucket has a capacity (bucket depth) of B tokens. Tokens arrive into the token bucket according to an unusual arrival process where the inter-token-arrival time between two consecutive tokens is 1/r. We will call r the token arrival rate (although technically speaking, it‚Äôs not exactly the token arrival rate; please understand that this is quite different from saying that the tokens arrive at a constant rate of r). Extra tokens (overflow) would simply disappear if the token bucket is full. A token bucket, together with its control mechanism, is referred to as a token bucket filter.

check.) Otherwise, it will check if the token bucket has P or more tokens in it. If the token bucket has P or more tokens in it, P tokens will be removed from the token bucket and the packet will join the Q2 facility (technically speaking, you are required to first add the packet to Q1 and timestamp the packet, remove the P tokents from the token bucket and the packet from Q1 and timestamp the packet, before moving the packet into Q2), and wake up the servers in case they are sleeping. If the token bucket does not have enough tokens, the packet gets queued into the Q1 facility. Finally, if the number of tokens required by a packet is larger than the bucket depth, the packet must be dropped (otherwise, it will block all other packets that follow it).

The transmission facility (denoted as S1 and S2 in the above figure and they are referred to as the ‚Äúservers‚Äù) serves packets in Q2 in the first-come-first-served order and at a transmission/service rate of mu per second. When a server becomes available, it will dequeue the first packet from Q2 and start transmitting/servicing the packet. When a packet has received 1/mu seconds of service, it leaves the system. You are required to keep the servers as busy as possible.

When a token arrives at the token bucket, it will add a token into the token bucket. If the bucket is already full, the token will be lost. It will then check to see if Q1 is empty. If Q1 is not empty, it will see if there is enough tokens to make the packet at the head of Q1 be eligiable for transmission (packets in Q1 in also served in the first-come-first-served order). If it does, it will remove the corresponding number of tokens from the token bucket, remove that packet from Q1 and move it into Q2, and wake up the servers in case they are sleeping. It will then check the packet that is now at the head of Q1 to see if it‚Äôs also eligiable for transmission, and so on.

Technically speaking, the ‚Äúservers‚Äù are not part of the ‚Äútoken bucket filter‚Äù. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs part of this assignment to emulation/simulation the severs because the servers are considered part of the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù to be emulated. (For the purpose of this spec, we will use the term ‚Äúemulation‚Äù and ‚Äúsimulation‚Äù interchangeably.)

Our system can run in only one of two modes.

Deterministic : In this mode, all inter-arrival times are equal to 1/lambda seconds and all service times are equal to 1/mu seconds (both these values must be rounded to the nearest millisecond), and all packets require exactly P tokens. If 1/lambda is greater than 10 seconds, please use an inter-arrival time of 10 seconds. If 1/mu is greater than 10 seconds, please use an service time of 10 seconds.

In either mode, if 1/r is greater than 10 seconds, please use an inter-token-arrival time of 10 seconds. Otherwise, please round the inter-token-arrival time to the nearest millisecond.

Your job is to emulate the packet and token arrivals, the operation of the token bucket filter, the first-come-first-served queues Q1 and Q2, and servers S1 and S2. You also must produce a trace of your emulation for every important event occurred in your emulation. Please see more details below for the requirements.

You must use:

one thread for packet arrival one thread for token arrival one thread for each server

You must not use one thread for each packet.

In addition, you must use at least one mutex to protect Q1, Q2, and the token bucket. (It is recommended that you use exactly one mutex to protect Q1, Q2, and the token bucket.)

Finally, Q1 and Q2 must have infinite capacity (i.e., you should use My402List from warmup assignment #1 to implement them and not use arrays).

Compiling

Please use a Makefile so that when the grader simply enters:

make warmup2

an executable named warmup2 is created (minor variation is permitted if you document it). Please make sure that your submission conforms to other general compilation requirements and README requirements.

Commandline

The command line syntax (also known as ‚Äúusage information‚Äù) for warmup2 is as follows: warmup2 [-lambda lambda] [-mu mu] [-r r] [-B B] [-P P] [-n num] [-t tsfile]

Square bracketed items are optional. You must follow the UNIX convention that commandline options can come in any order. (Note: a commandline option is a commandline argument that begins with a ‚Äì character in a commandline syntax specification.) Unless otherwise specified, output of your program must go to stdout and error messages must go to stderr.

The default value (i.e., if it‚Äôs not specified in a commandline option) for lambda is 1 (packets per second), the default value for mu is 0.35 (packets per second), the default value for r is 1.5 (tokens per second), the default value for B is 10 (tokens), the default value for P is 3 (tokens), and the default value for num is 20 (packets). B, P, and num must be positive integers with a maximum value of 2147483647 (0x7fffffff). lambda, mu, and r must be positive real numbers.

Running Your Code and Program Output

The emulation should go as follows. At emulation time 0, all 4 threads (arrival thread, token depositing thread, and servers S1 and S2 threads) got started. The arrival thread would sleep so that it can wake up at a time such that the interarrival time of the first packet would match the specification (either according to lambda or the first record in a tracefile). At the same time, the token depositing thread would sleep so that it can wake up at a time such that the inter-tokenarrival time between consecutive tokens is 1/r seconds and would try to deposit one token into the token bucket each time it wakes up. The actual arrival time of the first packet p1 is denoted as time T1, the actual arrival time of the 2nd packet p2 is denoted as time T2, and so on.

As a packet or a token arrives, or as a server becomes free, you need to follow the operational rules of the token bucket filter. Since we have four threads accessing shared data structures, you must use the tricks you learned from Chapter 2 related lectures. Please also check out the slides for this assignment for the skeleton code for these threads.

You are required to produce a detailed trace for every important event occurred during the emulation and every such event must be timestamped. Each line in the trace must correspond to one of the following situations:

If a packet is served by a server (server S1 is assumed below for illustration), there must be exactly 7 output lines that correspond to this packet. They are:

p1 arrives, needs 3 tokens, inter-arrival time = 503.112ms

p1 enters Q1

p1 leaves Q1, time in Q1 = 247.810ms, token bucket now has 0 token

p1 enters Q2

p1 leaves Q2, time in Q2 = 0.216ms

p1 begins service at S1, requesting 2850ms of service p1 departs from S1, service time = 2859.911ms, time in system = 3109.731ms

The value printed for ‚Äúinter-arrival time‚Äù must equal to the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 arrives‚Äù event minus the timestamp of the ‚Äúarrives‚Äù event for the previous packet.

The value printed for ‚Äútime in Q1‚Äù must equal to the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 leaves Q1‚Äù event minus the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 enters Q1‚Äù event.

The value printed for ‚Äútime in Q2‚Äù must equal to the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 leaves Q2‚Äù event minus the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 enters Q2‚Äù event.

The value printed for ‚Äúrequesting ???ms of service‚Äù must be the requested service time (which must be an integer) of the corresponding packet.

The value printed for ‚Äúservice time‚Äù must equal to the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 departs from S1‚Äù event minus the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 begins service at S1‚Äù event (and it should be larger than the requested service time printed for the ‚Äúbegin service‚Äù event).

The value printed for ‚Äútime in system‚Äù must equal to the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 departs from S1‚Äù event minus the timestamp of the ‚Äúp1 arrives‚Äù event.

If a packet is dropped, you must print:

p1 arrives, needs 3 tokens, inter-arrival time = 503.112ms, dropped

If &lt;Ctrl+C&gt; is pressed by the user, you must print the following (and print a ‚Äò ‚Äò before it to make sure that it lines up with all the other trace printouts):

SIGINT caught, no new packets or tokens will be allowed

If a packet is removed when it‚Äôs in Q# (Q1 or Q2) because &lt;Ctrl+C&gt; is pressed by the user, you must print:

p1 removed from Q#

If a token is accepted, you must print:

token t1 arrives, token bucket now has 1 token

If a token is dropped, you must print:

token t1 arrives, dropped

When you are ready to start your emulation, you must print:

emulation begins

When you are ready to end your emulation, you must print:

emulation ends

All the numeric values above are made up. You must replace them with the actual packet number, actual number of tokens required, actual server number, measured inter-arrival time, measured time spent in Q1, actual number of tokens left behind when a packet is moved into Q2, measured time spent in Q2, measured service time, and measured time in the system.

The output format of your program must satisfy the following requirements.

You must first print all the emulation paramters. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

Whenever a token arrives, you must assign a number to it, and add it to the token bucket. You must then print its arrival time, the fact that it has arrived, and the number of tokens in the the token bucket. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

Whenever a packet arrives, you must assign a number to it. You must then print its arrival time, the fact that it has arrived, the number of tokens it needs for transmission, and the time between its arrival time and the arrival time of the previous packet. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

You then must append this packet onto Q1. Afterwards, you must then print the time this packet entered Q1 and the fact that it has entered Q1. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

Later on, when this packet leaves Q1, it removes the correct number of tokens from the token bucket. You must then print the time this packet leaves Q1, the fact that it has left Q1, the amount of time it spent in Q1, and the number of tokens in the the token bucket. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

You must then append this packet onto Q2. Afterwards, you must then print the time this packet entered Q2 and the fact that it has entered Q2. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

Later on, when this packet leaves Q2 and enters the server, you must then print which server the packet entered, the time the packet begin service, the fact that it has begun service, and the amount of time it spent in Q2. Please see the sample printout for what the output must look like.

Statistics:

average packet inter-arrival time = &lt;real-value&gt; average packet service time = &lt;real-value&gt;

average number of packets in Q1 = &lt;real-value&gt; average number of packets in Q2 = &lt;real-value&gt; average number of packets at S1 = &lt;real-value&gt; average number of packets at S2 = &lt;real-value&gt;

average time a packet spent in system = &lt;real-value&gt; standard deviation for time spent in system = &lt;real-value&gt;

token drop probability = &lt;real-value&gt; packet drop probability = &lt;real-value&gt;

In the Emulation Parameters section, please print the emulation parameters specified by the user or the default values mentioned above. Please do not print the ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù values because certain parameters are too small. (For example, if lambda is 0.01, you must print 0.01 and not 0.1.)

After Emulation Parameters section comes the Event Trace section. The first column there contains timestamps and they correspond to event times, measured relative to the start of the emulation. Every emulation event must be timestampted. You need to figure out how to make sure that the timestamp values look reasonable (e.g., never decrease in value). Please use 8 digits (with leading zeroes) to the left of the decimal point and 3 digits after the decimal point for all the timestamps in this column. All time intervals must be printed in milliseconds with 3 digits after the decimal point. In the printout, after emulation parameters, all values reported must be measured values.

In the Statistics section, the average number of packets at a facility can be obtained by adding up all the time spent at that facility (for all relevant packets) divided by the total emulation time. The time spent in system for a packet is the difference between the time the packet departed from the server and the time that packet arrived. The token drop probability is the total number of tokens dropped because the token bucket was full divided by the total number of tokens that was produced by the token depositing thread. The packet drop probability is the total number of packets dropped because the number of tokens required is larger than the bucket depth divided by the total number of packets that was produced by the arrival thread.

Please use sample means when you calculated the averages. If n is the number of sample, this mean that you should divide things by n (and not n-1).

The unit for time related statistics must be in seconds (and not milliseconds).

Var(X) = E(X2) ‚Äì [E(X)]2

When you are keep statistics, you should keep a running average.

You can divide the packets into 3 categories.

1. Completed packets: these are the packets that made it all the way to the server and completed service at the server.

2. Dropped packets: these are the packets arrived into the system but never made it even to Q1 because it needs too many tokens.

3. Removed packets: these are the packets that got into Q1 to begin with but never made it to the server.

All packets should participate in the calculation of the average packet inter-arrival time and packet drop probability statistics. Only completed packets should participate in the calculation of the average packet service time statistics. Only completed packets should participate in the calculation of the average number of packets in Q1/Q2/S1/S2 and time spent in system statistics.

Finally, when no more packet can arrive into the system, you must stop the arrival thread as soon as possible. Also, when Q1 is empty and no future packet can arrive into Q1, you must stop the token depositing thread as soon as possible.

Trace Specification File Format

The trace specification file is an ASCII file containing n+1 lines (each line is terminated with a ‚Äù ‚Äú) where n is the total number of packets to arrive. Line 1 of the file contains a positive integer which corresponds to the value of n. Line k of the file contains the inter-arrival time in milliseconds (a positive integer), the number of tokens required (a positive integer), and service time in milliseconds (a positive integer) for packet k-1. The 3 fields are separated by space or tab characters (or any combination of any number of these characters). There must be no leading or trailing space or tab characters in a line. If a line is longer than 1,024 characters (including the ‚Äò ‚Äò at the end of a line), it is considered an error. A sample tsfile for n=3 packets is provided. It‚Äôs content is listed below:

3

2716 2 9253

7721 1 15149 972 3 2614

In the above example, packet 1 is to arrive 2716ms after emulation starts, it needs 2 tokens to be eligible for transmission, and its service time should be 9253ms; the inter-arrival time between packet 2 and 1 is to be 7721ms, it needs 1 token to be eligible for transmission, and its service time should be 15149ms; the inter-arrival time between packet 3 and 2 is to be 972ms, it needs 3 token to be eligible for transmission, and its service time should be 2614ms.

In the above example, you should treat these numeric values as ‚Äútargets‚Äù or your emulation. In your trace output, you need to print what you measured (i.e., by reading the clock). It should be very unlikely that a measured inter-arrival time or a measured service time has exactaly the same value as its corresponding target value. For example, the interarrival time of packet 3 is suppose to be 972 milliseconds. If the reported actual inter-arrival time between packets 2 and 3 is exactly 972.000 milliseconds, you should look for bugs in your code! Actually, you should probably get a different value every time your rerun your emulation.

This file is expected to be error-free. (This means that if you detect a real error in a tsfile, you must simply print an error message and call exit() immediately. You MUST NOT print statistics or attempt to recover from error in this case.)

You are expected to create your own tsfile to test your program. Make sure you know how to create test cases where you know for sure that packets will be wait in Q1, in Q2, or both. You should be able to look at your tsfile and predict what will happen in the trace and verify that your program printout is consistent with your prediction.

Minimum Emulation Time

If you have the fastest machine in the universe that there is no overhead anywhere (i.e., bookkeeping time is zero everywhere, takes zero time to execute any code, etc.) and it‚Äôs running a real-time OS that always sleeps exactly the amount of time you ask it to sleep, what would be the minimum simulation time when you run warmup2? Of course, this depends on the parameters of your simulation. Let‚Äôs take the sample tsfile shown above and think about when each packet will leave the simulation if we simply run:

./warmup2 -t tsfile.txt

1. If there is no overhead anywhere, packet p1 would arrive at exactly 2716ms into the simulation. At that time, the token bucket should have more than enough tokens for p1 and p1 would start transmitting immediately. Since the transmission time of p1 is 9253ms, p1 should finish transmission at time 11969ms.

2. Packet p2 would arrive at exactly 7721ms after the arrival time of packet p1. This means that packet p2 would arrive at time 10437ms. At that time, the token bucket should have more than enough tokens for p2 and p2 would start transmitting immediately. Since the transmission time of p2 is 15149ms, p2 should finish transmission at time 25586ms.

3. Packet p3 would arrive at exactly 972ms after the arrival time of packet p2. This means that packet p3 would arrive at time 11409ms. At that time, the token bucket should have more than enough tokens for p3. But, both servers are busy. Therefore, p3 must wait in Q2. The server that transmitted p1 would finish first at time 11969ms and it would start transmitting p3 as soon as it becomes available. Since the transmission time of p3 is 2614ms, p3 should finish transmission at time 14583ms.

Grading Guidelines

For your convenience, a copy of the grading scripts are made available here:

section-A.csh section-B.sh section-A-all.sh section-B-all.sh

(Technically speaking, the scripts above are not ‚Äúgrading scripts‚Äù since they are just scripts provided for your convenience to save you some typing. The grader will not run these scripts when grading.)

After you have download the above shell scripts, please put them in the same directory as warmup2 and run the following command:

chmod 755 section-*.sh section-*.csh

A Perl script, ‚Äúanalyze-trace.txt‚Äù, is made available to help you to debug your program printout. (I have to name it as if it‚Äôs a text file. Otherwise, my web server would try to execute the Perl script.) Please read the comment at the top of the code to see how to use it. This code only works if your printout is in the right format and each regular packet has 7 lines of printout (with their timestamps in chronological order) and each dropped packet has 1 line of printout. If your printout has missing lines in the printout or if the lines are in the wrong order, you should fix your code and rerun this script!

For this assignments, please always use pthread_cond_broadcast() to wake up server threads. Please do not use pthread_cond_signal() anywhere in your code. (Yes, this is not the most efficient way. But since the grader must follow the grading guidelines when grading, this would most likely get you the most number of points.)

In section (A) of the grading guidelines, each test has a minimum emulation time. The numbers were obtained using the Minimum Emulation Time analysis mentioned above. If the running time of your code is too fast or too slow, it means that you have pretty serious bugs in your code and you need to get them fixed or you will end up losing a lot of points.

Miscellaneous Requirements &amp; Hints

Please read the general programming FAQ if you need a refresher on file I/O and bit/byte manipulications in C.

You must NOT use any external code segments to implement this assignment. You must implement all these functionalities from scratch.

You must NOT use semaphores to implement this assignment. You must implement thread synchronization using pthread mutex and condition variable. If you use something like a semaphore, you will lose a lot of points!

You are required to use separate compilation to compile your source code. You must divide your source code into separate source files in a logical way. You also must not put the bulk of your code in header files!

Please use gettimeofday() to get time information with a microsecond resolution. You can use select() or usleep() (or equivalent) to sleep for a specified number of microseconds.

I do not recommend using a signal handler to catch SIGINT. You are strongly advised to use a separate SIGINTcatching thread and uses sigwait().

Removing packets are part of the emulation. Therefore, removing of each packet must be timestamped and you must not terminate your emulation before you have removed all the packets.

If &lt;Ctrl+C&gt; is pressed and you print the ‚ÄúSIGINT caught‚Äù message in the printout, you must print a timestamp for this event.

Your code must not ‚Äúbusy-wait‚Äù! ‚ÄúBusy-waiting‚Äù means that you have code that‚Äôs staying in a tight loop to wait for some condition to become true. Such code is very unfriendly to the environment you are running your program in. Therefore, you must not do busy-waiting. If you find a piece of busying waiting code, just insert ‚Äúusleep(100000)‚Äù inside the loop to sleep for 0.1 second before checking the condition again. Since it‚Äôs so easy to not do busywaiting, if the grader sees that your code is doing busy-waiting, a lot of points will be deducted. (Please understand that this is just a quick and dirty fix! The correct way to wait for some condition to become true is to sleep in a CV queue as discussed in lectures.)

If your code is not doing anything useful (i.e., just waiting for something) and you run ‚Äútop‚Äù from the commandline on your 32-bit Ubuntu 16.04 system and you see that your program is taking up one of the top spots in CPU percentages and showing something like more than 0.5%, there is a good chance that you have busywaiting code. In this is the case, run your code under gdb and run ‚Äútop‚Äù in another terminal. When your code is not doing anything useful and your process starts to show up in ‚Äútop‚Äù, press &lt;Ctrl+C&gt; in gdb. Hopefully, your program will break inside your busy-waiting loop (use the where command to see where you are inside gdb)!

Here are some additional hints:

For this assignment, you are implementing a time-driven emulation (and not an event-driven simluation such as the ns-2 in networking). For an event-driven emulation, you can easily implement this project using a single thread and an event queue. In a time-driven emulation, a thread must sleep for the amount of time that it supposes to take to do the a job. For example, if a server would take 317 milliseconds to serve a job, it would actually sleep (using select/usleep()) for some period of time so that the packet seem to stay in the server for 317 milliseconds. Similarly, if the arrival thread needs to wait 634 milliseconds between the arrivals of packets p1 and p2, it should sleep for some period of time so that it looks like packet p2 arrives 634 milliseconds after packet p1 has arrived.

Continue with the above example, if it took more than 634 milliseconds to do bookkeeping and to enqueue the packet to the queueing system, what should you do? Since you cannot sleep for a negative number of microseconds, you should skip sleeping. This is ‚Äúbest-effort‚Äù emulation. You are not required to hit the target time, you just need to try your best to match inter-arrival times. When you cannot, you should still try your best (i.e., 0 is the closest number to a negative number).

Submission

All assignments are to be submitted electronically (including the required ‚ÄúREADME‚Äù file). To submit your work, you must first tar all the files you want to submit into a ‚Äútarball‚Äù and gzip it to create a gzipped tarfile named warmup2.tar.gz. Then you upload warmup2.tar.gz to the Bistro system. The command you can use to create a gzipped tarfile is:

tar cvzf warmup2.tar.gz MYLISTOFFILES ls -l warmup2.tar.gz

Where MYLISTOFFILES is a list of file names that you are submitting (you can also use wildcard characters if you are sure that it will pick up only the right files). DO NOT submit your compiled code, just your source code and README file. Two point will be deducted for each binary file included in your submission (e.g., warmup2, .o, .gch, core, etc.). The last command shows you how big the created ‚Äúwarmup2.tar.gz‚Äù file is. If ‚Äúwarmup2.tar.gz‚Äù is larger than 1MB in size, the submission server will not accept it.

A w2-README.txt template file is provided here. You must save it as your w2-README.txt file and follow the instructions in it to fill it out with appropriate information and include it in your submission. You must not delete a single line from w2README.txt. Please make sure that you satisfy all the README requirements.

Here is an example commands for creating your warmup2.tar.gz file: tar cvzf warmup2.tar.gz Makefile *.c *.h w2-README.txt

If you use an IDE, you need to modify the commands above so that you include ALL the necessary source files and subdirectories and make sure you have not forgotten to include a necessary file in order for the grader to compile your code on a ‚Äúclean‚Äù system.

You should read the output of the above commands carefully to make sure that warmup2.tar.gz is created properly. If you don‚Äôt understand the output of the above commands, you need to learn how to read it! It‚Äôs your responsibility to ensure that warmup2.tar.gz is created properly.

To check the content of warmup2.tar.gz, you can use the following command:

tar tvzf warmup2.tar.gz

Please read the output of the above command carefully to see what files were included in warmup2.tar.gz and what are their file sizes and make sure that they make sense.

Please enter your USC e-mail address and your submission PIN below. Then click on the Browse button and locate and select your submission file (i.e., warmup2.tar.gz). Then click on the Upload button to submit your warmup2.tar.gz. (Be careful what you click! Do NOT submit the wrong file!) If you see an error message, please read the dialogbox carefully and fix what needs to be fixed and repeat the procedure. If you don‚Äôt know your submission PIN, please visit this web site to have your PIN e-mailed to your USC e-mail address.
